# RetinaNet

This is an unofficial pytorch implementation of RetinaNet object detection as described in [Focal Loss for Dense Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02002) by Tsung-Yi Lin, Priya Goyal, Ross Girshick, Kaiming He and Piotr DollÃ¡r.

## result
we trained this repo on 4 GPUs with batch size 8 (4 image per node). the total epoch is 24 ,Adam with cosine lr decay is used for optimizing.
finally, this repo achieves 34.6 mAp at 896px(max side) resolution with resnet50 backbone.

## training
for now we only support coco detection data.

* run train scripts
```shell script
 python -m torch.distributed.launch --nproc_per_node=4 main.py
```
